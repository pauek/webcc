<h1 class=title>Documentation of uevalrun</h1>

<p><b>uevalrun</b> is a self-contained computation sandbox for Linux, using
User-mode Linux for both compilation and execution of the program to be
sandboxed. The program can be written in C, C++, Python, Ruby, Perl,
JavaScript, Lua or PHP. uevanrun enforces memory limits, timeouts and output
size limits in the sandbox. The primary use case for uevalrun is evaluation
of solution programs submitted by contestants of programming contests:
uevalrun compiles the solution, runs it with the test input, compares its
output against the expected output, and writes a status report.

<h2>Installation</h2>

<p>A 32-bit (x86, i386) or 64-bit (x86_64, amd64) Linux system is required
with enough RAM for both compilation and execution, plus 6 MB memory
overhead. The Linux distribution doesn't matter, because uevalrun uses
statically linked binaries, and it's self-contained: it contains all the
tools it needs, including the C and C++ compilers (from the uClibc gcc-4.1.2
toolchain).

<p>uevalrun doesn't need root privileges: it runs as a simple user.

<p>uevalrun needs about 160MB of disk space, most of which is consumed by
the C compiler (31MB extracted + 17MB compressed), the scripting language
interpreters (9MB compressed), and the virtual disk images (77MB,
uncompressed). After removing all temporary files, 80MB will be enough.

<p>Download and compile:

<pre>$ svn co http://pts-mini-gpl.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/uevalrun uevalrun
$ cd uevalrun
$ ./make  # This downloads some more files during compilation.</pre>

<p>Try it (the italic parts are displayed by the program):

<pre>$ (echo '#! perl'; echo 'print "Hello"x2, "\n"') >foo.pl
$ echo HelloHello >expected.txt
$ ./uevalrun -M 10 -T 9 -E 9 -s foo.pl -t /dev/null -e expected.txt
<i>...
@ result: pass</i>
$ echo '/**/ int main() { return!printf("HelloHello\n"); }' >foo.c
$ ./uevalrun -M 10 -T 9 -E 9 -U 19 -N 32 -C 9 \
  -s foo.c -t /dev/null -e expected.txt
<i>...
@ result: pass</i></pre>

<h2>How to use</h2>

<p>TODO(pts): Write this section.

<h2>Requirements</h2>

<p>Security is the most important requirement of uevalrun, followed by high
performance and usability.

<p>The sandboxing must be secure, more specifically:

<ul>
<li>Programs inside the sandbox must not be able to communicate with
    the outside world, except for their stdin and stdout. So they don't have
    access to the filesystem (except for some read-only access to some
    whitelisted system libraries and binaries), and they can't do network
    I/O. If uevalrun is used for programming contest submission evaluation,
    this restriction prevents the program from finding and reading the file
    containing the expected output.
<li>Sandboxed programs must not be able to use more system resources (memory,
    disk, CPU) than what was allocated for them.
<li>Sandboxed programs must not be running for a longer period of time than
    what was allocated.
<li>Even the compilation of programs to be run (executed) inside the sandbox
    must be sandboxed (possibly with different system resource allocation),
    to prevent the attacker from submitting a program source code which
    exploits a bug in the compiler.
<li>The sandbox must be reverted to its initial state before each compilation
    and execution, so sandboxed programs won't be able to gather information
    about previous compilations and executions. For programming contests,
    this restriction prevents the program from reading other contestants'
    submissions or their output.
<li>Timeouts (both real time and user time) must be enforced outside the
    sandbox, so the program will be reliably killed if it runs for too long
    time, even if it tampers with time measurement inside the sandbox.
<li>Sanboxed programs must not be able to lie about their success, their
    performance or the correctness of their output by writing special marker
    characters to their stdout or stderr.
</ul>

<p>The sandbox must be fast and waste few resources, more specifically:

<ul>
<li>Reverting the sandbox to its initial, empty state must be very fast
    (preferably faster than 1 second).
<li>Starting a program inside the sandbox must be very fast (preferably
    faster than 1 second).
<li>Running a program inside the sandbox must not be much slower than running
    the same program outside the sandbox. If the program is CPU-intensive,
    it may run 1.1 times slower (i.e. 10% slower) inside than outside. If
    the program is I/O-intensive, it may run 10 times slower inside than
    outside. This requirement is intentionally quite loose on I/O
    virtualization performance.
<li>Running a program inside the sandbox must not need more than 10MB more
    memory than running the same program outside.
<li>Running a program inside the sandbox must not need any disk space,
    except for the disk space needed by the program binary, the test input
    and the expected output, all stored as files outside the sandbox.
<li>Compilation inside the sandbox must require only a reasonable amount of
    temporary disk space (for the file to be compiled, the temporary files,
    and the output binary).
</ul>

<p>The sandbox must be easy to use and versatile, more specifically:

<ul>
<li>Sandboxed programs must be able to accept any 8-bit binary input (stdin).
<li>Sandboxed programs must be able to write any 8-bit binary output to
    their stdout.
<li>Multiple sandboxed programs must be able to run at the same time on the
    same host system, without affecting each other.
<li>If a sandboxed program fails (e.g. because it writes to its stdout
    different from what was expected, or it does a memory access violation,
    it reaches a timeout, it exceeds its allocated memory etc.), the proper
    failure reason has to be reported (e.g. ``wrong answer'' must not be
    reported if the program times out or vice versa).
<li>The sandboxing software must have as little few system dependencies as
    possible. It must be able to run in a restricted (e.g. chroot)
    environment, it must not depend on system libraries or configuration.
    It must work on 32-bit (x86, i386) and 64-bit (x86_64, amd64) Linux
    systems, on any Linux distirubution.
<li>Sandboxed programs can be written in C, C++, Python, Ruby, Perl,
    JavaScript, Lua and PHP,
    or in any language whose compiler can produce a 32-bit (i386) Linux
    statically linked executable binary.
</ul>

<h2>Design</h2>

<p>To fullfill the requirements, the following fundamental building blocks
are used.

<p><a href="http://user-mode-linux.sourceforge.net/">User-mode Linux</a>
(UML) is used for virutalization: both compilation and execution is
performed in a UML guest, reading data from the host system using virtual
block devices (<code>ubd</code>), and writing its output to its
<code>/dev/tty1</code> (<code>con0</code>), which can be read by a process
on the host. A UML guest kernel (currently 2.6.31.1) tailered to the
sandboxing requirements (security and performance) is configured and
compiled. Some kernel patches are applied to increase security, reliability
and performance. (Please note that these patches apply to the UML guest
kernel only, so the host remains unpatched, and rebooting is not needed
either.) Networking and the virtual file system are disabled in the UML
guest kernel for increased security. All unnecessary drivers and features
are removed from the UML guest kernel to get fast boot times and to reduce
the overhead.

<p>The underlying virtualization technology used by UML is
<a href="http://linux.die.net/man/2/ptrace">ptrace()</a>, which doesn't need
root privileges or a kernel module or kernel modifications in the host. As
an alternative to UML, <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seccomp">Seccomp</a> could be used for
sendboxing, but that's quite cumbersome, because the sandboxed process
cannot allocate memory for itself (see <a
href="http://code.google.com/p/seccompsandbox/">the Google Chrome Seccomp
sandbox</a> for a generic solution), but it's still prohibitively cumbersome
to sandbox GCC this way (with its requirements for forking and creating
temporary files). Most sandboxing approaches on Linux require root
privileges for a short amount of time (for chroot, PID namespaces (see
<a href="http://linux.die.net/man/2/clone">clone(2)</a>) and other
namespaces). Most virtualization approaches (like <a
href="http://www.linux-kvm.org/">KVM</a>, <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xen">Xen</a>, <a
href="http://www.virtualbox.org/">VirtualBox</a>, except possibly for
<a href="http://wiki.qemu.org/">QEMU</a>) need loading of kernel modules or
patching the kernel, and support only slow guest boot times.

<p>With UML, it's possibly to boot the UML guest, run a hello-world binary,
and halt the UML guest in less than 0.02 second (sustained). For that speed,
one needs a (guest) kernel patch (included and automatically applied in
uevalrun) which skips the <i>Calibrating delay loop</i> kernel startup step,
which usually takes 0.33 second. The memory overhead of UML is also quite
low (6 MB with a stripped-down kernel).

<p>All software running inside and outside UML is written in C (for high
performance) and compiled with <a href="http://www.uclibc.org">uClibc</a>
and linked statically to avoid depending on the libc on the host, and to
avoid the need for installing a libc in the guest. (The total size of these
custom-built binaries is less than 100kB.) There is no Linux distribution
installed the guest &ndash; only a few custom binaries are copied, like a
custom <code>/sbin/init</code>, which mounts <code>/proc</code>, sets up
file descriptors and resource limits, and starts the sandboxed program, and
then halts the guest. The <code>/lib</code> directory in the guest is empty,
except for compilation, where <code>/lib</code> contains
<code>libc.a</code>, <code>libstdc++.a</code> etc.

<p><a href="http://www.busybox.net/">BusyBox</a> (statically linked with
uClibc) is used as a Swiss Army Knife tool for scripting and automation (of
the build and the setup process), both inside and outside UML. Please note,
however, that once all the binaries are built and the filesystem images are
created, BusyBox is not used anymore for running sandboxed programs and
evaluating their output (except for temporary filesystem creation) because
of performance reasons, but work is done by the small and fast custom C
tools just compiled.

<p>Sandboxed program sources can be written in C (using a large subset of
<a href="http://www.uclibc.org/">uClibc</a> as the system library), C++
(using <a href="http://www.uclibc.org/">uClibc</a> and
<a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/libstdc++/">libstdc++</a>), Python (using
all the built-in Python modules), Ruby (using just the built-in Ruby
modules and classes which are implemented in C), Perl (using only the
few dozen most common modules),
JavaScript (with
  <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/js/spidermonkey/">SpiderMonkey</a>
  <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/En/SpiderMonkey/1.8">1.8</a>
  smjs-1.8.0, containing readline and print),
Lua (with the full luajit-1.1.6 available),
or PHP (using just the built-in PHP
functions which are implemented in C).

<p>For C and C++ compilation, a <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/">GCC</a> 4.1.2
toolchain is used which is based on
<a href="http://www.uclibc.org/">uClibc</a> and produces statically linked
executables.

<p>Interpreters for Python, Ruby, Perl, JavaScript, Lua and PHP are provided as
precompiled, self-contained, single, statically linked, 32-bit (i386) Linux
executables. It's easy to copy them to the <code>/bin</code> directory of
the UML guest.

<p>All tools used for building the software are either shipped with the
software, or the software downloads them during compilation. All binary
tools are statically linked, 32-bit (i386) Linux executables. This provides
maximum host system compatibility and reproducible behavior across systems.

<p>In our speed measurements, CPU-intensive programs running inside UML run
1% slower than outside UML, but I/O-intensive programs (such as C++
compilation with GCC) can be about 15 times slower.

<p>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MINIX_file_system">
Minix filesystem</a>
is used in the UML guests for both read-only filesystems (e.g. the
root filesystem with the scripting language interpreters) and read-write
filesystems (such as <code>/tmp</code> for the temporary assembly files
created by GCC). The Minix filesystem was chosen instead of ext2 and other
usual Linux filesystem, because it has less size overhead, it's codebase is
smaller, and it has equally good performance for the small and mostly
read-only filesystems it is used for.

<h2>How to make it faster?</h2>

<p>User-mode Linux runs CPU-bound programs only a few percent slower than how
fast they run natively on the host. But for programs that do lots of I/O
(such as compiling a C++ hello-world program containing <code>#include
&lt;iostream&gt;</code> with <code>g++</code>), User-mode Linux can be about
15 times slower than native execution. (On some machines, the same bechmark
is only 6 time slower.)

<p>For sandboxing C and C++ compilation with GCC we could use a method which
less overhead than User-mode Linux to reduce the slowdown factor of 15.
One direction is to use a more lightweight <code>ptrace()</code>-based
approach (thus running everything in userspace), and another direction is to
use a Linux kernel module (such as <i>apparmor</i>) for sandboxing.

<p>We've tried <a href="http://freshmeat.net/projects/sydbox">sydbox</a> for
sandboxing, and measured its speed versus native execution and User-mode
Linux. The result is surprising: User-Mode Linux is faster. Here are the
details:

<pre>$ cat scat.cc
//
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
using namespace std;
int main() {
  (cerr &lt;&lt; "error1\n").flush();
  cout &lt;&lt; "Hi!\nHello, C++ World!\n";
  cerr &lt;&lt; "error2" &lt;&lt; endl;
  return 0;
}

$ time $CXX -static -o /tmp/prog -W -Wall -s -O2 scat.cc 
real    0m0.326s
user    0m0.310s
sys     0m0.030s

$ ls -l sydbox

$ time ./sydbox -c t.conf -- $CXX -static -o /tmp/prog2 -W -Wall -s -O2 scat.cc

$ file uevalrun.linux.uml

$ time ./uevalrun.linux.uml con=null ssl=null con0=fd:-1,fd:1 mem=38M \

  ubddr=uevalrun.guestinit ubde=tmp.minix.img solution_format=gxx \

real    0m4.833s
user    0m0.920s
sys     0m1.760s</pre>

<p>Our conclusion is that it would be hard to beat the speed decrease of 15
provided by User-mode Linux &mdash; maybe we would have to write a
speed-optimized <code>ptrace()</code>-based sandbox in C from scratch. In
theory, this can work, because <code>strace -f -e getppid g++</code> is
only about 2.64 times slower than regular <i>g++</i>, so our optimized
implementation can be 3 times slower. We
should also measure G++ with another <code>ptrace()</code>-based sandboxing
method first.


<h2>Similar software</h2>

<a href="http://codepad.org/about">codepad</a> is similar to uevalrun: it
compiles and runs arbitrary user-submitted code in many languages. It uses a
custom sandboxing based on <code>ptrace()</code>, implemented in Haskell
(User-mode Linux used by uevalrun is also based in <code>ptrace()</code>).
